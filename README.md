# Fluid Quotes
Fluid Quotes make it easy to integrate metaprogramming into your project by allowing you to pass around quoted code just like regular objects while splicing them at compile-time!

Under the hood, fluid quotes are powered by _dependent types_, which propagate captured code across abstraction boundaries through the regular type-checking capabilities built into the host language. You can learn more about how fluid quotes work in our [research paper](https://www.shadaj.me/papers/fluid-quotes.pdf).
